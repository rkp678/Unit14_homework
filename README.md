# Unit 14 Homework: LSTM Stock Predictor - Rachel Pierce
## December 2021

## *Instructions:*
### Three main tasks:
1. Prepare the data for training and testing
2. Build and train customer LSTM RNNs
3. Evaluate the performance of each model

#
## *Please refer to the following documents in GitHub:*
- The **lstm_stock_predictor_closing.ipynb** and **lstm_stock_predictor_fng.ipynb** files (open in Jupyter Lab) for code details.

#

## Step 1: Prepare the data for training and testing
In process
## Step 2: Build and train custom LSTM RNNs
In process
## Step 3: Evaluate the performace of each model
In process
1. Which model has a lower loss?  
2. Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
3. Which window size works best for the model?
